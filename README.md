# ZeroWaste

Memory game written in SpriteKit based on environmental issues. Traps are visible for a few seconds, then disappear. User goal if to find path from rubish to trash without caming into fire. Game is split into rounds with different garbages and matching bins. Game has three difficulty levels. I did all graphics myself. Music is on free license.
